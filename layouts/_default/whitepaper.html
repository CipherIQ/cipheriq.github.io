      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>As organizations prepare for the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) era, they face a critical challenge: gaining comprehensive visibility into the cryptographic assets scattered across their infrastructure. This paper presents the architecture of a distributed Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) system that combines static analysis with runtime monitoring to provide complete cryptographic observability.</p>
      <p>The proposed architecture addresses a fundamental gap in existing approaches: static analysis alone cannot capture the cryptographic operations that actually occur at runtime, while runtime monitoring alone lacks the context of what was intended. By correlating both data sources, organizations can detect configuration drift, shadow cryptography, and migration gaps — the three most critical risk factors in any PQC transition.</p>

      <h3>The Core Insight</h3>
      <p>Traditional security tools treat cryptographic configuration as a point-in-time audit. But cryptographic posture is dynamic — it changes with every deployment, library update, and configuration change. A CBOM must be a <strong>living document</strong> that reflects both what is intended and what is actually running.</p>
